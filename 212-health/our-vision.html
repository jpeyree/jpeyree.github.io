                <h3>Muscle Tone</h3>
                <p>Muscle tone is not just about being big and strong.  Muscle toning involves developing the muscles, tendons and ligaments that are associated with range of motion and movement.  By using various exercise techniques and working the muscle from different angles this will not only build and strengthen your muscles but will also prevent injuries that can occur throughout our lives.</p>
