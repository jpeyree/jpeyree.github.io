            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as "a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable."
            <br><br>Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. John Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography[5] states "Some authorities regard eminences above 600 metres (1,969 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills."

            <h2>Block Mountains</h2>
            <p>Block mountains are caused by faults in the crust: a plane where rocks have moved past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain.[19] The uplifted blocks are block mountains or horsts. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa,[20] the Vosges and Rhine valley,[21] and the Basin and Range Province of Western North America.[22] These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned.</p>

            <h2>Volcanoes</h2>
            <p>Volcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot.[13] At a depth of around 100 km (60 mi), melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano.</p>

            <h2>Fold Mountains</h2>
            <p>Fold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened.[15] Since the less dense continental crust "floats" on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle.</p>
